### Project Logo

  - Zoom: 36%
  - Line Spacing: 10%
  - Use default for character spacing and rotation
  - Use the `Minecrafter Regular` font
  - Navigate to the background tab and uncheck `Background or Transparent` to make background transparent
  - Navigate to the download tab and select `Medium` quality with `fitted` aspect ratio

  After downloading your project logo all you have to do is rename it to `project-logo.png` and add it to the `./public/imgs` directory in your website folder
